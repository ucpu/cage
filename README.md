Cage is game engine/framework designed for programmers with focus on ease of use, dynamic games, and procedural content generation.

# Features

## Designed for programmers

- Cage is a collection of libraries and tools, not yet another editor.
- No visual programming - use c++ for the engine and for the game.
- All tools and assets are configured with simple ini-like text files, which is suitable for version control systems.

## Ease of use

- Cage is programming framework that creates consistent basis for engine, tools, and game development.
- It encourages readable, maintainable, and safe code, while also allowing for quick prototyping.
- Performance optimizations are added as necessary, without sacrificing simple api design.

## Portable

- Cage runs on Windows and Linux.
- It is mostly self-contained.
  - Most dependencies are accessed as git submodules and compiled in.
  - There are just few packages required on linux, none on windows.
- The Core library has no dependencies on graphics or sound and is suitable for running on headless servers.

## Friendly licensing

- MIT license lets you use Cage for personal and commercial products alike, for free, forever.
- All 3rd-party licenses are copied to single redistributable directory during build configuration.

# Contents

## Core library

- Framework stuff (strings, logging, configuration, events)
- Operating system abstraction (memory, filesystem, threading, networks)
- GLSL-like math and geometry primitives
- Image, triangle meshes, and sounds en/decoding and algorithms
- Entity + components framework
- Assets management
- Extensive tests

## Engine library

- Provides low-level/generic engine functionality
- Scene description with entities
- Window and input management
- Objective layer on top of OpenGL
  - Long term plan is to switch to Vulkan only
- Roughness/metallic workflow
- Graphics effects:
  - hdr, bloom, tonemapping, gamma correction
  - depth of field
  - ssao
  - fxaa
- Pipeline-like processing using multiple threads
  - *50 000 objects* at 30 fps (cpu-bound)
  - All objects go through automatic instancing
- Automatic shadowmaps
- Sound
- Gui
- Virtual reality

## Simple library

- Provides simpler interface for typical games
- Gameloop and timing
- Single globally accessible instance of window, gui, and scene
- Small utilities:
  - Fps camera controller
  - Fullscreen switcher
  - Statistics gui

## Tools

- Asset analyze - generates initial asset configuration for most files
- Asset database - manages asset configuration and automatic processing
- Asset processor - converts assets from wide variety of interchange formats to Cage specific formats
- Image convert - batch format conversion for images
- Image channels - split or join multiple channels to/from single image
- Image info - print information about an image
- Image resize - batch resizing of images
- Image untile - slices a single image with tiled sections into a sequence of individual images
- Mesh info - print information about a mesh
